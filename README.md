# Crop_Yield_Prediction
Classify crops and Forecast crop yields

This project proposes a smart agriculture system using a two-tier machine 
learning (ML) model for predicting crop yield. It comprises Preprocessing, Feature Selection, 
and Classification phases. In the Preprocessing phase, data undergoes rigorous cleaning and 
transformation to ensure its quality and readiness for analysis. Feature Selection uses CBFS 
and VIF algorithms, and Classification employs an aKNCN model for soil sample 
categorization. Prediction accuracy is enhanced using ELM with mBOA for dynamic weight 
adjustment. 
 This project provides an introduction to smart agriculture and highlights its importance.
Evaluation includes RMSE, R^2, MSE, MedAE, MAE, MSLE, MAPE, and EVS error metrics. 
Comparative analysis against conventional models such as ELM, ANN, SVM, GB, and RF 
assesses the proposed model's superiority in precision and efficiency.
